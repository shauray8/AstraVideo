documenting all the experiments I did in order to reach the final results (probably not everything only the intresting stuff!)
this mostly contains video frame interpolation after I get the results from interpolating the origional keyframe and have a video made out of it using the ip-adapter process 

1. RIFE [https://github.com/hzwer/ECCV2022-RIFE]

2. Depth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation [https://sites.google.com/view/wenbobao/dain]   

3. AMT: All-Pairs Multi-Field Transforms for Efficient Frame Interpolation [https://github.com/MCG-NKU/AMT]  
  - This is what I found to be the most intresting of them all 
  - the interpolations are pretty smooth and probably even faster then the above stated stuff 

4. Norm-guided latent space exploration for text-to-image generation [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08687]
